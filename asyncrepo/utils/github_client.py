"""
Welcome to Hackville! Okay, so let me explain what's going on here.

1. We're superclassing the GH client to override some methods we use with async versions.
    We do this by overriding the default requester for the client with a new one that
    refuses to actually process any requests, but instead raises an exception with the request's
    arguments and kwargs which can then be used to make an async request.

    Once the async request is ready, we'll add in the response object to the session object and
    then call the original method again. This is safe in terms of async/await, but it's not
    thread-safe since it assumes that the response added to the session will only be accessed
    by the subsequent call to the original method. Because of this, a threading lock is added
    to that critical section of code (not that this is really intended to be used in a threaded
    environment, but we might as well strive for thread-safety right?).

2. We're also patching the PaginatedList and GithubOject classes to add some async methods we use.

    The PaginatedList class has a get_page method that returns a PaginatedList object. An async version
    of this, get_page_async, is monkey-patched to handle this asynchronously. The PaginatedList class also has
    a totalCount property which we monkey-patch in an async equivalent method `total_count_async` to handle.

    The GithubObject class has a raw_data property that returns a dict. But, it also needs to make
    HTTP requests to get the data. An async version of this, raw_data_async, is monkey-patched to
    handle this asynchronously.

Obviously this is API abuse, but this entire project is at the mercy of external APIs anyway so... Ch√†o!
